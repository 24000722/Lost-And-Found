  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our University of Venda Lost and Found application.
    Where Students materials are lost and then retrieved by other Students then posted on the application, so the student who lost the material can get it back in no time.
     We understand how stressful it can be to lose important items like student card, laptop, keys, etc.
    So our platform provides a safe space to report both lost items and found items, as it requires founder identification, clear details, and proper verification to ensure no student can come and claim other studentsâ€™ items.
    All those measures ensure that the items get to their rightful ownership. </p>
    
  <p>Our mission is to create a supportive community where students can help each other recover lost belongings quickly and efficiently.
    We believe in the power of collaboration and trust, and we are committed to making our campus a safer place for everyone.</p>
    
  <p>By interacting with this platform, you're not only recovering lost belongings but helping create a responsible, safe, and supportive community.</p>

  <p>Thank you for being a part of our mission to make our campus a better place!</p>
