## Project Overview  
The **Lost and Found Application** is designed to help students easily report lost items and search for found belongings within the campus community. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can:  

- Report items they have lost or found.  
- Browse through available listings.  
- Connect with others to claim items.  

This system reduces the hassle of manually tracking belongings and makes it easier to reunite owners with their items.  

We chose this application for students because they frequently misplace accessories (such as phones, wallets, or books), especially during campus events. This solution helps ensure they can recover their belongings quickly and conveniently.

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (for structure and styling)  
- **Backend:** Java (to handle item posting, searching, and claims)  
- **Database:** SQL (to store items, student details, categories, and collection locations)  
- **Browser Support:** Works on all modern web browsers, with no extra installation required.
